<h2 id="what-is-it-and-why-use-it"><strong>What is it and why use it?</strong></h2>
<p>A baitcaster is a type of fishing rod that is used for a variety of fishing purposes. It is similar to a traditional <a href="https://vtfishandwildlife.com/fish/fishing-basics/fishing-rods-and-reels/spinning-rods-and-reels#:~:text=Unlike%20casting%20rod%20with%20line,single%20and%20multi%2Dpiece%20versions.">spinner rod</a>; however, the design of the reel and rod are slightly different. A baitcaster is often used for its versatility and controllability. A spinner rod is great for fishing open areas with a normal cast but baitcasters are beneficial for situations where an area is not as open and you do not have a lot of room for a normal cast. Baitcasters allow for more accurate casts and can be used for <a href="https://shopkarls.com/blog/everything-need-know-flipping-pitching">flipping baits</a> into covered areas.</p>

<h2 id="assembly"><strong>Assembly:</strong></h2>
<p>Some baitcasters are sold as a rod and reel combination so assembling them together is not necessary. However, in the event that you buy them separately, it is simple to attach the reel to the rod.</p>

<p>
1. Start by removing any plastic on the rod and reel.

<p><br>2. Then, unscrew the threaded keeper at the top of the rod&#39;s grip. </p>
<p><br>3. Place the reel seat into the slot on the rod and the other end under the threaded keeper. <br><em>Note: make sure the line guide is pointing toward the end of the rod and the release button is on the handle side.</em> </p>
<p><br>4. Screw the threaded keeper tightly back.
<br><br><br></p>
<h2 id="lining-the-rod"><strong>Lining the rod:</strong></h2>
<p>The next step in preparing your baitcaster is spooling the fishing line on the reel. Most people should start with medium test (6 - 10 lb), <a href="https://hookedinfishing.com/fishing-line/monofilament/">monofilament</a> or <a href="https://www.berkley-fishing.com/berkley-ae-why-use-fluorocarbon">fluorocarbon</a> line. The instructions are as follows:</p>

<p>

<ol>
<li><p>Thread the line down the guides of the rod starting at the end opposite the reel and grip.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thread the line through the line guide on the front of the reel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Push the line around the spool and tie a small knot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While applying tension to the line with one hand, crank the reel with the other. 
<br><em>Note: holding the new fishing line spool on a screwdriver or something similar makes it easier and faster to unspool.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Continue until the fishing line on the reel reaches just short of the edges of the spool.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clip the line at the end of the rod giving yourself a couple of feet of line to work with.</p>
<br></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings"><br><strong>Settings:</strong></h2>
<p>After adding your bait to the end of the line, it is important to set your reel to the correct settings before casting. There are a couple of settings that can be tuned to work best with your casting technique, the weight of your bait, and the strength of your line. Before describing the settings, it is important to note that most of the settings are dependent on the user and are set based simply on feel so it may take some trial and error to get them right. Also, reference the first picture if you can not locate the settings.</p>
<h4 id="drag-control"><strong>Drag control:</strong></h4>
<p>Starting with the simplest, the drag control is the spiked wheel that is usually connected to the inner side of the crank and it controls the amount of drag on the line. Increasing the drag makes it more difficult to pull the line out of the reel and decreasing the drag makes it easier. It is important to note that you may want to decrease the drag when you are using a weaker fishing line or when trying to catch larger fish. This will lessen the chances of the line snapping. To set the drag:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Grab the fishing line just in front of the reel and pull out towards the end of the rod.
<br><em>Note: If the line is easy to pull, you will want to increase the drag and vice versa.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Release the fishing line and rotate the drag control clockwise to tighten the drag and counterclockwise to loosen it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat these steps until the drag is set correctly.
<br><em>Note: There is no specific setting for the drag. A good setting should make the line resistant but not difficult to pull from the reel.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="spool-tensioner"><strong>Spool tensioner:</strong></h4>
<p>Another setting on a baitcaster is the spool tensioner which is a small knob that is usually on the same side as the handle of the reel. This changes the tension on the spool and affects how quickly and easily it will unwind. This setting should be changed based on the weight of the bait you have on the rod. It is best practice to increase the spool tension when using heavier bait. To set the spool tensioner:</p>

<p>
<br>1. Test the tension by pressing the release button just behind the spool. 

<p><br>2. Let the bait fall freely from the end of the rod.</p>
<p><br>3. Rotate the spool tensioner closkwise if the bait falls very rapidly or counterclockwise if the bait does not fall at all.</p>
<p><br>4. Repeat these steps until the bait falls very slowly from the end of the rod.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<h4 id="brake-setting"><strong>Brake setting:</strong></h4>
<p>The final setting is the brake setting which is usually on the opposite side of the reel as the handle. It affects how quickly the spool will unwind. Most users who are new to using baitcasters will want to increase this setting since it makes it more resistant to getting a backlash (<a href="#the-dreaded-backlash">explained later</a>). It can also depend on the weight of your bait since lighter baits may require a greater braking setting. To set the brake:</p>

<p>
1. Start with the brake setting dial pointing to the middle.

<p><br>2. Take a few practice casts to test the setting.</p>
<p><br>3. Increase the brake setting if you get a backlash or if there is any loose line in the reel after casting. Decrease the brake setting if there is no loose line.
<br><em>Note: decreasing the brake setting can increase casting distance, especially when using heavier bates; however, it could increase your chances of getting a backlash.</em></p>
<p><br>4. Repeat these steps until you find a comfortable brake setting.
This setting requires a few casts to tune it to where it is best for your cast. For those with more experience, decreasing the braking setting can increase the users casting distance, especially when using heavier baits.</p>
<h1 id="using-your-baitcaster"><br>Using Your Baitcaster</h1>
<h2 id="casting"><strong>Casting:</strong></h2>
<p>The movement required to cast a baitcaster is the same as casting any other fishing rod. The main differences are the release button and stopping the spool. Note, failing to stop the spool when the bait hits the water will result in a backlash.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="the-dreaded-backlash"><strong>The Dreaded Backlash:</strong></h2>
<p>A backlash is when the reels spool spins too quickly and the fishing line can not make it out of the reel in time. This causes the line to build up in the reel and get tangled. Some backlashes can be small and easily fixed while others get more tangled and result in what many people refer to as a bird&#39;s nest. To avoid this, it is important to cast smoothly and without excessive force. It is also important to stop the spool with your thumb, as previously stated, before the bait hits the water. If you do get a backlash, here&#39;s how to fix it:</p>

<p>
<br>1. Start by pressing the release button and gently pulling the line just outside the line guide.

<p><br>2. If it does not come untangled, try to untangle the line on the spool and then gently pull more out from the line guide.</p>
<p><br>3. Continue this until the backlash is gone.</p>
<p><br>4. Then, re-spool the line you pulled out in the same way you spooled it in the beginning (adding pressure to the line with one hand).
